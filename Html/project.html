        <p>Adam is a computer science student, at the University of San Francisco, and he is very applied. He doesn't waste a minute when it comes to study and work because he was raised that way, and because of that, he tends to order food online to economize time. In his little free time, he likes to run at the local park, and tries to live a healthy life.</p>
        <p>Steven is a police officer in Los Angeles, he is a loving father, but also a hard worker, who spends most of his day patrolling or attending emergencies. He was always very picky when it comes to eating, and that, added to the fact that he spends a lot of time at a car and alert to everything, brings him a lot of problems, that's why he resorted to fast food chains, that taste the same in every local.</p>

        <h3>Competitive audit report</h3>
        <p>After investigating our competitors, we discovered that they share a lot of characteristics, as well as some flaws.
            Most of them have been in the market for quite a time, something that earned them the love of their clients, who expect the same experience to be delivered to them by others food chains, if not better.
            Here are some of the opportunities that we discovered.</p>
